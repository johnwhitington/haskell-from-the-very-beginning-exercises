Haskell from the Very Begining
==============================

These are the examples and exercises for the book "Haskell from the Very
Beginning" which can be obtained at
[http://www.haskellfromtheverybeginning.com/](http://www.haskellfromtheverybeginning.com).

Where answers depend on functions written earlier, they are included in the
file too.

The alternative solution to Chapter 13, Exercise 5 is due to Jolien Oomens.

In case of errata, please open a bug report here.
